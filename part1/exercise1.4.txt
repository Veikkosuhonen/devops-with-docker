After a few failed attempts (doing things in the wrong order, 
being confused by accidental detaching from stdin...),
I got it working by running the container with:

	docker run -it -d --name e4 ubuntu \ 
	sh -c 'echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website;'

Then I entered the container with

	docker exec --it e4 bash

and run

	apt update; apt install curl

and exited the bash. Then I attached to the process with

	docker attach e4

and inputted 'helsinki.fi', giving me the desired result. 
An obvious way to streamline the process would be to include the installation of dependencies
in the initial shell script by appending to the start:

	apt update; apt install curl -y;
